# Gaussian-Fitter

Usage of this project allows to perform fitting calculation of sum of any number of gaussian functions to data which is encoded in tsv format.

# Usage

You can select any range to be displayed on figure or to be used for calculations, and any number of gaussian fuctions to sum (tho, the maximum needed for proper samples analysis is 5).
Next set initial values of every parameter for optimization method (least-squares).
Figure contains spectrum in given range, the one in which calculations are being done is shown by vertical lines, functions on figure are single gaussians and their sum for initial and fitted parameters.
After any change of parameters the figure will update automatically.

# Additional info

Presented project depicts the way that I analysed data for my Bachelors deegree work. It involved fitting of sum of multiple gaussian functions to spectral absorption data with wavelengths in X-axis in range 500-600nm.
It is NOT original code that i have used for my work, only a clean presentation of how it was done.
In samples you can find spectral data for which this project has been designed for.
You can let me know if you have any thoughts abouts my this very first project.
