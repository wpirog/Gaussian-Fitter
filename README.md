# Gaussian-Fitter

Usage of this project allows to perform fitting calculation of sum of any number of gaussian functions to data which is encoded in tsv format.

# Usage

I used streamlit in order to show cleanly process of gaussian fitting

# Additional info

Presented project depicts the way that I analysed data for my Bachelors deegree work. It involved fitting of sum of multiple gaussian functions to spectral absorption data with wavelengths in X-axis in range 500-600nm.
It is NOT original code that i have used for my work, only a clean presentation of how it was done.
More information TBA...
